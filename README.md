# aish

A little binary that'll give your shell context to chatgpt, along with a question.
It'll try to return a command that you can inspect and then run. 

- Usage:
  - `c help me get the sound from this video as an mp3`

# Goals

- I don't want a repl, I want something I can invoke
- Ideally it gets context when I do
  - pwd
  - ls
  - git status
  - history
  - shell output?
  - extendable here
- Usage:
  - `c help me get the sound from this video as an mp3`


## TODO
- pick an http client etc and write the api client
- come up with a way to build this into a nice binary
